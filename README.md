# Javascript Metronome

A basic metronome that I made using javascript html and css. I was unsatisfied with the google metronome's lack of "click to edit" feature, so I made my own that included it. 

# Features

- visual feedback of bpm 
- use spacebar to start/stop metronome
- 3 methods of adjusting bpm
    - slider
    - plus + and minus - buttons
    - click to edit and type in bpm manually (resets if invalid input)
